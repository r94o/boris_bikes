## Boris Bikes Project

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, have come to us with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. 

This program will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
